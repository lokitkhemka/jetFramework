# jetFramework

I am writing this framework to understand how various types tests are written for performance-critical physics simulation application.

This repo is just my interpretation of the original repository: https://github.com/doyubkim/fluid-engine-dev

Dependencies are included in the repo. I am using Clang compiler to compile the project. Currently, it only supports Windows.
